<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine with roots in ancient India. It says that our bodies are made up of three doshas, or elemental principles: <i>vata</i> (air and space), <i>pitta</i> (fire and water), and <i>kapha</i> (earth and water). We are healthy when these doshas are in balance.

This REST API provides information on the effects of specific food items on the three doshas, so that you or those who use your application can make dietary choices that are informed by ayurveda.
